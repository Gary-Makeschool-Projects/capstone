Today we're going to look at how to price your domains in order to land you more sales.\n\n**Why pricing matters**\n\nBuyers don't like to be left in the dark. For some end-users having no fixed price is a barrier to transact with you. They want to know exactly how much your domain will cost them. Therefore it is advised to add buy-nows prices to your domains. Also, enable installments to make your domains more affordable for startups.\n\n**The right price for your domains**\n\nBuying and selling domain names is a matter of supply and demand, prices fluctuate based on the interest of buyers. Therefore, it's incredibly important to set realistic buy-now prices. Not sure how much you should ask? Simply, experiment once in a while with adjusted prices to see how the market responses. Use our bulk price editing tools to do this easily.\n\nHere are some of the factors that influence the value of your domains:\n\n- **Number of characters**: the shorter, the better\n- **Extension / language combination**: .com is by far the most valuable extension. However, it's better to use .com if you are using a term in the English language\n- **Dictionary words**: domains that include real words are more valuable\n- **Search volume**: if a lot of people are searching for this keyword on Google, then your domain has more value\n- **Type-in traffic**: do people type your domain directly into their browser? The more type-ins, the better!\n\n**Setting prices in your portfolio**\n\nLog in to your account and click \"portfolio\" in the menu bar on top. Here you see your list of all your domains. Click on the dotted gray line in the \"buy now\" or \"starting offer\" column, fill in your numbers and hit enter to save.\n\nThat's all for now.

There are already plenty of barriers for novice end-users to acquire a domain from the secondary market. Let's work on removing some of those barriers by presenting yourself in a trustworthy way.\n\nBelow are some easy steps to gain more trust:\n\n- **Personalize your profile**: add a picture to your profile and set a background for example.\n- **Biography**: fill in your bio, tell something about yourself or your company. Why do you sell domains? What's your profession? etc.\n- **Real name**: use your real name or the name of your company.\n- **Negotiations**: talk with potential buyers instead of only shooting numbers to them.
